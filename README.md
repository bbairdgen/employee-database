# employee-database

## Description

This is a relational database that I built for HR or Employers to track their employees. It allows you to add and track individuals throughout a company as well as how much they made. I learned alot about how to run queries through Javascript. I also learned how to conduct multiple joins on a single table. 

## Installation

This is a CLI application and will need to be run from your CLI. 

## Usage

Once you have opened your CLI, make sure you run "npm -i". This will ensure that the necessary files are installed. After, make sure that you go to the index.js file and change the user and password to match your MYSQL user and password. 

When you have added the information, run "node index" to start the application from scratch. If you want to use the default seeds, you need to run "npm run seed" before you run "node index".
